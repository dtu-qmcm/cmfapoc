# Compositional Metabolic Flux Analysis - proof of concept

The aim of this project is to demonstrate that compositional data analysis does a better job than non-compositional on a representative dataset.

We will use a dataset that Sergi previously generated, consisting of measurements of E. coli, to make a fake dataset, assuming some realistic true isotopologue fractions and a plausible compositional error model. We'll then fit the data using compositional analysis and non-compositional analysis, and see how different the results are.
