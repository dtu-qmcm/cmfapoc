  abstract = {Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) has emerged as a tool of great significance for metabolic engineering and mammalian physiology. An important limitation of MFA, as carried out via stable isotope labeling and GC/MS and NMR measurements, is the large number of isotopomer or cumomer equations that need to be solved, especially when multiple isotopic tracers are used for the labeling of the system. This restriction reduces the ability of MFA to fully utilize the power of multiple isotopic tracers in elucidating the physiology of realistic situations comprising complex bioreaction networks. Here, we present a novel framework for the modeling of isotopic labeling systems that significantly reduces the number of system variables without any loss of information. The elementary metabolite unit (EMU) framework is based on a highly efficient decomposition method that identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate isotopic labeling within a reaction network using the knowledge of atomic transitions occurring in the network reactions. The functional units generated by the decomposition algorithm, called elementary metabolite units, form the new basis for generating system equations that describe the relationship between fluxes and stable isotope measurements. Isotopomer abundances simulated using the EMU framework are identical to those obtained using the isotopomer and cumomer methods, however, require significantly less computation time. For a typical 13C-labeling system the total number of equations that needs to be solved is reduced by one order-of-magnitude (100s EMUs vs. 1000s isotopomers). As such, the EMU framework is most efficient for the analysis of labeling by multiple isotopic tracers. For example, analysis of the gluconeogenesis pathway with 2H, 13C, and 18O tracers requires only 354 EMUs, compared to more than 2 million isotopomers.},

In this review we introduce methodology to resolve metabolic fluxes from stable isotope labeling and relevant techniques in model development, model simplification, flux uncertainty analysis and experimental design that together is termed metabolic flux analysis. Finally we discuss applications using metabolic flux analysis to elucidate mechanisms pertinent to tumor cell metabolism. We hope that this review gives the readers a brief introduction of how flux analysis is conducted, how technical issues related to it are addressed, and how its application has contributed to our knowledge of tumor cell metabolism.},

  abstract = {13C Metabolic Fluxes Analysis (13C MFA) remains to be the most powerful approach to determine intracellular metabolic reaction rates. Decisions on strain engineering and experimentation heavily rely upon the certainty with which these fluxes are estimated. For uncertainty quantification, the vast majority of 13C MFA studies relies on confidence intervals from the paradigm of Frequentist statistics. However, it is well known that the confidence intervals for a given experimental outcome are not uniquely defined. As a result, confidence intervals produced by different methods can be different, but nevertheless equally valid. This is of high relevance to 13C MFA, since practitioners regularly use three different approximate approaches for calculating confidence intervals. By means of a computational study with a realistic model of the central carbon metabolism of E. coli, we provide strong evidence that confidence intervals used in the field depend strongly on the technique with which they were calculated and, thus, their use leads to misinterpretation of the flux uncertainty. In order to provide a better alternative to confidence intervals in 13C MFA, we demonstrate that credible intervals from the paradigm of Bayesian statistics give more reliable flux uncertainty quantifications which can be readily computed with high accuracy using Markov chain Monte Carlo. In addition, the widely applied chi-square test, as a means of testing whether the model reproduces the data, is examined closer.},

  abstract = {Precise quantification of metabolic pathway fluxes in biological systems is of major importance in guiding efforts in metabolic engineering, biotechnology, microbiology, human health, and cell culture. 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) is the predominant technique used for determining intracellular fluxes. Here, we present a protocol for 13C-MFA that incorporates recent advances in parallel labeling experiments, isotopic labeling measurements, and statistical analysis, as well as best practices developed through decades of experience. Experimental design to ensure that fluxes are estimated with the highest precision is an integral part of the protocol. The protocol is based on growing microbes in two (or more) parallel cultures with 13C-labeled glucose tracers, followed by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC--MS) measurements of isotopic labeling of protein-bound amino acids, glycogen-bound glucose, and RNA-bound ribose. Fluxes are then estimated using software for 13C-MFA, such as Metran, followed by comprehensive statistical analysis to determine the goodness of fit and calculate confidence intervals of fluxes. The presented protocol can be completed in 4 d and quantifies metabolic fluxes with a standard deviation of {$\leq$}2\%, a substantial improvement over previous implementations. The presented protocol is exemplified using an Escherichia coli {$\Delta$}tpiA case study with full supporting data, providing a hands-on opportunity to step through a complex troubleshooting scenario. Although applications to prokaryotic microbial systems are emphasized, this protocol can be easily adjusted for application to eukaryotic organisms.},

  abstract = {The validity of model based inference, as used in systems biology, depends on the underlying model formulation. Often, a vast number of competing models is available, that are built on different assumptions, all consistent with the existing knowledge about the studied biological phenomenon. As a remedy for this, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) facilitates parameter and structural inferences based on multiple models simultaneously. However, in fields where a vast number of alternative, high-dimensional and non-linear models are involved, the BMA-based inference task is computationally very challenging.Here we use BMA in the complex setting of Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) to infer whether potentially reversible reactions proceed uni- or bidirectionally, using 13C labeling data and metabolic networks. BMA is applied on a large set of candidate models with differing directionality settings, using a tailored multi-model Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The applicability of our algorithm is shown by inferring the in vivo probability of reaction bidirectionalities in a realistic network setup, thereby extending the scope of 13C MFA from parameter to structural inference.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
